# Gemini-In-Application
 This application is used for using Gemini in the Android application, I used Gemini API which is used to communicate with Gemini in the application when the user sends the message and to receive the response to that message.
 
- To run this application on your system you have to create Gemini API for yourself and then you have to add it here:
    app > src > main > java > com > example > chatbotusinggeminiapi > Utils.kt
- Here you have to enter the API you have created from AI studio by Google.
 
- You can create it from here: <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey" target="_blank">https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey</a>
